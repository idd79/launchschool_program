# Exercises: Medium 2

# Q1.Figure out the total age of just the male members of the family.

munsters = {
  "Herman" => { "age" => 32, "gender" => "male" },
  "Lily" => { "age" => 30, "gender" => "female" },
  "Grandpa" => { "age" => 402, "gender" => "male" },
  "Eddie" => { "age" => 10, "gender" => "male" }
}

sum_ages = 0
munsters.select { |_, v| v["gender"] == "male" }.values.each { |item| sum_ages += item["age"] }

p sum_ages

# Q2. One of the most frequently used real-world string properties is that of "string substitution", where we take a hard-coded string and modify it with various parameters from our program.

# Given this previously seen family hash, print out the name, age and gender of each family member:

munsters = {
  "Herman" => { "age" => 32, "gender" => "male" },
  "Lily" => { "age" => 30, "gender" => "female" },
  "Grandpa" => { "age" => 402, "gender" => "male" },
  "Eddie" => { "age" => 10, "gender" => "male" },
  "Marilyn" => { "age" => 23, "gender" => "female"}
}

# like this
# (Name) is a (age) year old (male or female).

munsters.each do |name, details|
  puts "#{name} is a #{details["age"]} year old #{details["gender"]}"
end

# Q3. How can we refactor this exercise to make the result easier to predict and easier for the next programmer to maintain?

def tricky_method(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param += "rutabaga"
  # an_array_param << "rutabaga"
  an_array_param += ["rutabaga"]

  return a_string_param, an_array_param
end

my_string = "pumpkins"
my_array = ["pumpkins"]
# tricky_method(my_string, my_array)
my_string, my_array = tricky_method(my_string, my_array)

puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"

# Q4. Use this technique to break up the following string and put it back together with the words in reverse order:

sentence = "Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall."

p sentence.split(/\W/).reverse.join(" ") + "."

# Q5. What is the output of the following code?

answer = 42

def mess_with_it(some_number)
  some_number += 8
end

new_answer = mess_with_it(answer)

p answer - 8
p new_answer

# Q6.

munsters = {
  "Herman" => { "age" => 32, "gender" => "male" },
  "Lily" => { "age" => 30, "gender" => "female" },
  "Grandpa" => { "age" => 402, "gender" => "male" },
  "Eddie" => { "age" => 10, "gender" => "male" },
  "Marilyn" => { "age" => 23, "gender" => "female"}
}

def mess_with_demographics(demo_hash)
  demo_hash.values.each do |family_member|
    family_member["age"] += 42
    family_member["gender"] = "other"
  end
end

p mess_with_demographics(munsters)
p munsters

# Q7.

def rps(fist1, fist2)
  if fist1 == "rock"
    (fist2 == "paper") ? "paper" : "rock"
  elsif fist1 == "paper"
    (fist2 == "scissors") ? "scissors" : "paper"
  else
    (fist2 == "rock") ? "rock" : "scissors"
  end
end

# What is the result of the following call?

puts rps(rps(rps("rock", "paper"), rps("rock", "scissors")), "rock")

# Q8.

def foo(param = "no")
  "yes"
end

def bar(param = "no")
  param == "no" ? "yes" : "no"
end

# What would be the output of this code?

p bar(foo)
